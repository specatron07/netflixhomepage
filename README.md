ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project with you all! ðŸŽ‰

I've just finished creating a fully functional Netflix homepage using nothing but HTML and CSS! 

Here are some highlights:

ðŸŽ¬ Sleek Design: I've replicated the clean and intuitive design of the Netflix homepage, complete with vibrant images and smooth transitions.

ðŸ“º Content Carousel: You can scroll through a selection of popular movies and TV shows, just like on the real Netflix site.

ðŸ”Ž Search Functionality: I've added a search bar that lets you search for your favorite movies and series, making it easy to find what you want.

ðŸ’¡ Responsive: The design is responsive, so it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices
